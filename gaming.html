        <h1>Is gaming benficial to society?</h1>
        <p>Many people have the misguided belief that video games
            lead to a rotting brain, but is this the case?
            In fact, many studies have concluded that video games actually benefit our cognition. They can help with 
            many skills in life including, but not limited to: 
            <ul>
                <li>Problem solving</li>
                <li>Spatial logic</li>
                <li>Reaction time</li>
                <li>Hand eye coordination</li>
                <li>Strategic thinking</li>
            </ul> 
             Depending on the games you play, different skills can 
            be improved.
