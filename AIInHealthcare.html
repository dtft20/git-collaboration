        <h2>Alphafold and protein folding</h2>
        <p>Protein folding refers to the way in which a chain of amino acids folds to form proteins. The order of the amino acids determines how the amino acids fold together, and hence the function of the protein.</p>
        <p>The structure of proteins can be determined expreimentally through the use of techniques like x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance [<a href="#r1">1</a>], but these techniques are time consuming and expensive. Due to the trial and error nature of x-ray crystallography, you can expect to find the structure of a protein within a few days or weeks [<a href="#r2">2</a>]. On the other hand, alphafold can find the shape of the protein "within a few days" [<a href="#r1">1</a>]</p>
